# BI_And_Migration_SQL
Project carried out for the subject data management.
The project consisted of migrating the data from a single completely denormalized table (for example, sales, purchases, customers, etc. were all together) to a normalized model (one table for each relevant entity).
Then we had to create a Business Intelligence (BI) model, where we had to do certain business analyzes on previously normalized data. For example, the top 5 products with the highest annual profitability should be obtained, or the average shipping price per shipping method per month and year. For this, fact tables and corresponding dimensions were created to speed up the process of obtaining this information.
The project was carried out using the T-SQL language with the SQL Server engine (version 2012).
