# BI_And_Migration_SQL
The project consisted of migrating the data from a single completely denormalized table. Then we had to create a Business Intelligence (BI) model, where we had to do certain business analyzes on previously normalized data. The project was carried out using the T-SQL language with the SQL Server engine.
